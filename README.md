Java L-Systems and Turtle Graphics

This is a very basic L-System generating program using 2D Turtle Graphics. This program takes an L-System to be defined as a starting rule, a set of generation rules and an angle to use for rotations.

The L-System configuration file also includes parameters such as the initial positon and orientation of the Turtle, the distance to travel at "every move forward" command and finally the number of iterations to apply to the L-System.
In this way, every L-System has a high degree of configuration and this can be done very easily.

Possible extensions: adding a 3D component, handle stochastic L-Systems and define a way to incorporate multiple colors into the L-System generation process.
